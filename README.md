[SCIDOG algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973188) for non-dermoscopic melanoma and naevus segmentation. 

This example program uses Maven to handle dependencies; it can most easily be run by downloading the repository and opening it as a [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org) project.

The example images come from the public [MED-NODE](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2015.04.034) dataset, which can be found here: cs.rug.nl/~imaging/databases/melanoma_naevi/
